That's why we will use a data set about .fancy[animals] to learn some R Basics.

## Animal Ageing and Longevity Database


Say we want to know how old an animal is in *human years*.

--

We can use the following simple formula to determine that:

<br>

$$\frac{\text{Maximum lifespan human}}{\text{Maximum lifespan non-human animal}} = \text{animal to human years ratio}$$

<br>

*Note: This is just a **very rough** way to determine the conversion ratio. It is **much more** complicated in [reality](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/).*

### Math Operators


Say we want to know how old a dog is in *human years*.

--

The observed maximum lifespan of a human is 122.5 years. For dogs it is 24.

--

.details[
```{r}
122.5/24
```
]

So for every year a human ages, a dog "ages" 5.08 human years. How old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

```{r}
5.08333333333333*15

## So many numbers..


Now it can be quite tedious to juggle all those numbers around. 

Especially if we want to keep reusing numbers we calculated before.

--

Here to simplify that process are:

**Objects**


---

class: inverse, middle, center

# R Basics

### R Objects

---

## R Objects

You can think of R objects as *saving information*, for example simple numbers or just plain text. 

Once saved we can recall it whenever we want by just running the name of the object.

--

> Everything that exists in R is *.red[an object]*. .fifty[~John M. Chambers]

--

We create R objects by using the assignment operator: 

<center>
.large[**`<-`**]
</center>

.right[
.fifty[You can also assign with the **`=`** sign but we will not be using this here.]
]

---

## R Objects

Here is an example:

```{r}
human_lifespan  <- 122.5
dog_lifespan <- 24
```

If we now run the respective objects we retrieve the saved numbers.

.details[
```{r}
human_lifespan
```
]

.details[
```{r}
dog_lifespan
```
]


---


## R Objects


Now we can perform the same calculation as before but this time using objects!

```{r}
dogs_to_human <- human_lifespan / dog_lifespan
```

The object `dogs_to_human` now holds the dog to human years conversion ratio.

--

*Now* we ask again: how old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

.details[
```{r}
dogs_to_human*15
```
]

---

## A quick note on naming things

.leftcol[
> Note that object names could be *anything* here!  I could have chosen to just name them `x`, `y` and `z`. 



I typically use lower-case snake case in this style: `animal_rights`.
 
Also recommended by the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html).

## More operators..

But wait there are more operators: .fancy[logical operators]

--

Logical operators are used for logical tests which can result in either: 

$\text{TRUE}$ or $\text{FALSE}$

*(sometimes this is also called a boolean variable)*



---
class: inverse, middle, center

# R Basics

### Logical Operators

---

## Logical Operators

Let's first create some more objects to try some logical tests!

```{r}
lion_lifespan <- 27
mouse_lifespan <- 4
fly_lifespan <- 0.3
boar_lifespan <- 27
alligator_lifespan <- 77
greenland_shark_lifespan <- 392
galapagos_tortoise_lifespan <- 177
```


---

## Logical Operators



`==` asks whether two values are the same or **equal**

The code below tests the following statement: 

*The maximum lifespan of a lion equals that of a boar.*

.details[
```{r}
lion_lifespan == boar_lifespan
```
]

--

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` this is of course a **`TRUE`** statement.

---

## Logical Operators

`!=`  asks whether two values are the *not* the same or **unequal**

The code below tests the following statement: 

*The maximum lifespan of a lion **does not equal** that of a boar.*

.details[
```{r}
lion_lifespan != boar_lifespan
```
]

--

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` (as we saw before) this is of course a **`FALSE`** statement.


---


## Logical Operators

We can also test whether certain values are greater or smaller than others:

`>` greater than

The code below tests the statement: 

*The lifespan of a human is greater than the lifespan of a fly.*

.details[
```{r}
human_lifespan > fly_lifespan
```
]

--

Since the maximum human lifespan is `122.5` and a fly does not live longer than `0.3` years this is of course a **`TRUE`** statement.

---

## Logical Operators


`<` smaller than

The code below tests the statement: 

*The lifespan of an alligator is smaller than the lifespan of a mouse.*

.details[
```{r}
alligator_lifespan < mouse_lifespan
```
]

--

Since the maximum alligator lifespan is `77` and a mouse lives for `4` years maximum, this is of course a **`FALSE`** statement.

--

Also note the following options:

`>=` greater or equals and `<=` smaller or equals

---


## Combine Logical Operators

We can also combine logical tests by testing multiple statements at the same time:

* `&` stands for "and" (unsurprisingly)
* `|` stands for "or"

For example both `alligator_lifespan` and `fly_lifespan` have to be greater than `mouse_lifespan` for the code below to evaluate as `TRUE`.

.details[
```{r}
alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan & 
fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan
```
]



---



## Combine Logical Operators

We can also combine logical tests by testing multiple statements at the same time:

* `&` stands for "and" (unsurprisingly)
* `|` stands for "or"

If we say `|` (= or) instead, it means either statement evaluation to `TRUE` is enough!

.details[
```{r}
alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan | 
fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan
```
]

---


## Even more objects..?

Now we learned about operators and some basic objects. 

But so far objects have only ever held a *single numeric value*. 

R is of course much more powerful than that and objects can hold any number and types of data.

--

Now we will take a look at **vectors**, or objects that include more than one value.

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# R Basics

### Vectors

---

## Vectors

You can simply imagine vectors as a list of values. They can consist of numbers but also *strings* (or: text).

In order to create a vector in R we make use of `c()` (stands for *concatenate*)


.details[
```{r}
c(1, 100, 1000, 2000, 5000)
```
]

We can also create a vector of strings by using quotes:


.details[
```{r}
c("I", "am", "a", "vector", "of", "strings")
```
]

---


## Vectors

We can combine the lifespans we assigned into objects earlier:


```{r}
animal_lifespans <-  c(greenland_shark_lifespan, dog_lifespan, 
  galapagos_tortoise_lifespan,
  mouse_lifespan, fly_lifespan,
  lion_lifespan, boar_lifespan,
  alligator_lifespan, human_lifespan)
```

.details[
```{r}
animal_lifespans
```
]


---


## Vectors

We can also create a vector of strings by using quotes:

.details[
```{r}
animals <- c("greenland_shark", "dog", 
  "galapagos_tortoise", "mouse", 
  "fly", "lion", "boar",
  "alligator", "human")
```
]



.details[
```{r}
animals
```
]


---


## Vectors

Now if we wanted to get the different year conversation ratios we can simply divide the maximum human age number by the vector.

.details[
```{r}
human_lifespan / animal_lifespans
```
]

Notice how the operation is performed for each item separately and the result is yet another vector.


---

## Vectors

We can also use *logical* operators with vectors:

.details[
```{r}
animal_lifespans > human_lifespan
```
]

Again, notice how the operation is performed for each item separately and the result is yet another vector, this time consisting of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s.

---


## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

An incredibly useful operator for vectors is **`%in%`**. 

The operator checks whether multiple elements occur somewhere in your vectors.

This basic usage looks like this:

$\color{red}{\text{vector1}}$ %in% $\color{orange}{\text{vector2}}$


---


## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`


Let's say we want to check whether `giraffe`, `greenland_shark` or `lion` occur in `animals`. 

If we use `|` we would have to write something like this:

```{r, eval=F}
animals == "giraffe" | animals == "greenland_shark"  | animals == "lion"
```

--

With `%in%` we can simply pass a vector like this:

```{r, eval=F}
animals_to_check <-  c("giraffe", "greenland_shark", "lion")
animals %in% animals_to_check
```

---

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

Doesn't look that much better? 

Now imagine you have dozens or hundreds of animals to check!

---

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

With **`|`** it's utter chaos.

.fifty[
```{r}
animals == "honey_bee" | animals == "cardiocondyla_obscurior" | animals == "black_garden_ant" | animals == "pheidole_dentata" | animals == "squinting_bush_brown" | animals == "american_lobster" | animals == "firebelly_toad" | animals == "oriental_firebelly_toad" | animals == "yellow_bellied_toad" | animals == "american_toad" | animals == "western_toad" | animals == "yosemite_toad" | animals == "great_plains_toad" | animals == "green_toad" | animals == "canadian_toad" | animals == "red_spotted_toad" | animals == "sonoran_green_toad" | animals == "southern_toad" | animals == "veragoa_stubfoot_toad" | animals == "common_european_toad" | animals == "colorado_river_toad" | animals == "kihansi_spray_toad" | animals == "ridge_headed_toad" | animals == "cuban_toad" | animals == "european_green_toad" | animals == "colombian_giant_toad" | animals == "argentine_toad" | animals == "cane_toad" | animals == "eurura_toad" | animals == "common_horned_frog" | animals == "colombian_horned_frog" | animals == "amazonian_horned_frog" | animals == "ornate_horned_frog" | animals == "green_and_black_dart_poison_frog" 
```
]

---

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`


With **`%in%`** it's much more sensible.


.fifty[
```{r}
animals_to_check <-  c("honey_bee", "cardiocondyla_obscurior", "black_garden_ant", "pheidole_dentata", "squinting_bush_brown", "american_lobster", "firebelly_toad", "oriental_firebelly_toad", "yellow_bellied_toad",  "american_toad", "western_toad", "yosemite_toad", "great_plains_toad", "green_toad", "canadian_toad", "red_spotted_toad", "sonoran_green_toad", "southern_toad", "veragoa_stubfoot_toad", "common_european_toad",  "colorado_river_toad", "kihansi_spray_toad", "ridge_headed_toad", "cuban_toad", "european_green_toad","colombian_giant_toad", "argentine_toad", "cane_toad", "eurura_toad", "common_horned_frog", "colombian_horned_frog", "amazonian_horned_frog", "ornate_horned_frog")

```
]


```{r}
animals %in% animals_to_check

# R Basics

### Indexing (with vectors)

---


## Indexing

When you want to know a specific value within your object you can use indexing.

Indexing is done via square brackets `[]`.

The basic setup looks like this:

$$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{elements}}]$$
---


## Indexing

Exracting the first element of a vector:

```{r}
animal_lifespans[1]
```

```{r}
animals[1]
```

---

## Indexing

Exracting the fifth element of a vector:

```{r}
animal_lifespans[5]
```

```{r}
animals[5]
```


---

## Indexing with logical tests

You can also index using logical tests. 

So if an expression evaluates to `TRUE` it will **keep** that element and when it evaluates to `FALSE` it will remove the **element**.

$$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{vector of TRUE/FALSE of same length}}]$$
---


## Indexing with logical tests

Let's first take a look at a logical test that extracts all animals that have greater lifespans than humans:


```{r}
longer_living <- animal_lifespans > human_lifespan

longer_living
```

Now we can use square brackets to only keep those animals that have greater lifespans than humans.

```{r}
animals[longer_living]
```


---

## Functions

> Everything that happens in R is *.red[a function]*. .fifty[~John M. Chambers]

You can think of functions as little machines that (in most cases) process some kind of **input** and create an **output**. 

Input is everything that goes *into* a function:

*   **arguments** you can think of as (pre-determined) input types like a lever or numpad.

*   **values** you can think of as the various settings that the levers or numpads can have.

$$\text{function_name}(\color{orange}{\text{argument}}=\color{lightblue}{\text{value}})$$

You can think of functions as little machines that (in most cases) process some kind of **input** and create an **output**. 

Input is everything that goes *into* a function:

*   **arguments** you can think of as (pre-determined) input types like a lever or numpad.

*   **values** you can think of as the various settings that the levers or numpads can have.

*Let's take a look at an example:  the star producer!*

## The Star Producer

Let's consider the following function (that does not exist unfortunately):
A `star_producer`!

This little machine creates tiny hand-drawn stars depending on some input. It takes two arguments:

* `how_many` tells the machine how many stars to produce
* `type` tells the machine how the stars should look like (in this case the machine only supports `"squiggly"` stars but it could be upgraded in the future when we learn how to create our own functions later on)

---

## Getting `?help`

How do we know what function takes what kind of arguments?

Within R you can always run the code:

```{r,eval=F}
?function_name
```

And it will open up the *documentation* for the function that will tell you how to use it.

## An example function: `seq`

From the help file we can learn that this function is used to 

> "[g]enerate regular sequences".

Its first three arguments are this:

* `from`, `to`: the starting and (maximal) end values of the sequence. 

* `by`: number: increment of the sequence.



Let's first take a look at this within our machine allegory.

---

```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/hertieschool_datasciencesummerschool/master/img/seq2.png")
```

---

## An example function: `seq`
If we would want to create a vector from 1 to 10 that increments by 1 we can simple specify the following input values for the arguments:

* `from`: 1
* `to`: 10
* `by`: 1


This is how that looks like in code:

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
```


---

### Passing Values

Now there are two ways to pass values to functions in R:

1.   Pass by argument *names* (we already did this above!)
2.   Pass by argument *position*

In the former case, we specifically mention which arguments we want to pass our values to. 

For that, it doesn't matter in which **order** we pass our arguments.

```{r}
seq(to = 10, by = 1, from = 1)
```



---


### Passing Values by position

But: **coders are lazy**.

There is no need to always specify which argument you mean exactly when you can just match *by position*.

So our sequence example could just as well look like this:

```{r}
seq(1, 10, 1)
```

And it works because the documentation tells us that the first three arguments are `from`, `to`, and `by`.

In the future you will see it often that people just leave out the arguments completely so it's good to get used to it.

## More examples: Mean and Median

Many functions have so intuitive arguments that we often don't need to even look up the documentation.

An easy function to use is `mean` which simply calculates the average of a numeric vectors. 

Let's try this with the `animal_lifespans` we created earlier.

```{r}
mean(animal_lifespans)
```

The mean value is quite high!

---

## More examples: Mean and Median

We can also try and take the median value:

```{r}
median(animal_lifespans)
```

When we take the median instead of the mean we can see that this is due to high outliers (the median is of course more robust to extreme values).

There are many more functions in R and we will get to learn some of them during this workshop.

### Creating our own Functions

---


Let's define a function which squares numeric values. To do this, we use `function()` and encoded what is supposed to happen in curly brackets `{}`

```{r}
square <- function(input) { 
  output <- input^2        
  output                  
}
```

```{r}
square(2)   
```



> Tip: In RStudio we can just type `fun` and enter after the popup and RStudio will just automatically generate a template for a function.
